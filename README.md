# Simple-RNN-in-Keras
Practicing how to create, train and evaluate a simple RNN in Keras (no LSTMs etc)

Based on chapter 15 of [hands-on-machine-learning, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) by Aurelion Geron and similar Udacity excercises on implementing RNNs in PyTorch.
